Project 2 On TimeSeries

As an organization, Word aims to develop a mobile application leveraging
accelerometer data to detect instances of heavy drinking. The primary objective is to
create a user-friendly and reliable tool that can accurately identify patterns associated
with heavy alcohol consumption based on motion data captured by smartphones. This
app will utilize advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze accelerometer
readings and detect anomalies indicative of excessive drinking behavior. Additionally,
the app will prioritize user privacy and data security, ensuring that sensitive information
is handled with utmost confidentiality. The ultimate goal is to provide individuals with
valuable insights into their drinking habits, promote responsible alcohol consumption,
and potentially facilitate early intervention measures for those at risk of alcohol-related
harm

Project 3 (NLP)

In the rapidly evolving field of generative artificial intelligence (AI), identifying key
research themes and understanding their interconnections is crucial for academics,
practitioners, and policy makers. This project aims to utilize the comprehensive Web of
Science (WoS) database to search for publications related to generative AI. Through an
analytical approach focused on keyword co-occurrence networks derived from author
keywords, we will map the intellectual structure and identify the core themes and trends
in generative AI research.
